# Realtime AI Image App

In this app you can easily generate a realtime image of any hypothetical situation you can imagine.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Add a ```.env.local ``` file in the root directory and add your Fal.AI API Key in ```FAL_KEY``` variable

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
